Post creation steps:

1. On the EC2 console select the NAT instance -> Actions -> Change Source/Dest. Check -> Yes, Disable.
    NOTE: No known fix for CF scripts. May be other scripting solutions.
2. Connect to NAT instance via ssh and execute the following from the root account:
    $ /etc/init.d/named start
    TODO: CF init should be able to resolve this eventually. ensureRunning may fix this on the next run.
